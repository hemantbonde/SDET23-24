What are changes you have to make in IOS Testing ?
--> 
1) Desired Capablities 
 Common DC =  deviceName, automationName, platformName ,platformVersion, UDID
	app = path of application (to install app android or ios)
	bundleId= to launch app (if app is already present)

2) XCODE is IDE used for IOS Testing.
 	why we need xcode?
	--> It is IDE ( used by developers to develop application)
	--> To get Virtual Devices

3) WebDriver Agent
	
4) XPath changes (Syantax remains same but class name will be different for Android and IOS device)

5) 2 Locators are more (iOS Predicate String,IOS Class Chain)

6) Here App package and Appactivity is not available we have to use bundle id
7) Different command to get udid

Command to install ios-deploy: npm install -g ios-deploy
Command to get UDID: ios-deploy -c
OR
Command to get UDID: instruments -s devices

8) IOS Script will only execute on MacBOOK
